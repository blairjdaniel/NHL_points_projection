What is the question? How can I build a Moneyball type team.
assumptions, there might be some surprises as to player comparisons. 

Now that I can find the 5 closest players what to do next?

I could create a build your dream team under a cap?
            - each player has a salary that I can build using linear regression

Set the active / inactive for each player

Types of ML
Regression  - find salary
            - predict how many goals a player will get
            - using the bigger dataset, i could find player comparison for older players

How can this be useful for gambling?
            - player predictions for points
            
How can this help an NHL team?
            - Moneyball type team structure roster building

How can this help Hockey Analyist?
            - player comparisons
            - stats from the past reflected for the future 

How could I use API's?
            - salaries
            - the large dataset for older players
            -for the UI, player image and information

UI - What can it do, what will it look like?
            - Page loads
            - scrolldown bars at each location
            - looks like a hockey rink
            - 5 players on ice
            - 1 goalie
            - 15 on bench
            - once a selection is made, 5 comparables will load
                        - make sure you can't pick same player twice
            - each player image, stats show up once clicked
            - each player will have a salary attached to them
                        - use linear regression to fill in the salary compared to recent stats
            - there will be a counter with how much money they spent
            - once they are under the cap and have a full bench, its done
